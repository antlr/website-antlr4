<div class="block">The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.

 <p>
 The basic complexity of the adaptive strategy makes it harder to understand.
 We begin with ATN simulation to build paths in a DFA. Subsequent prediction
 requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for
 the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to
 complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state
 or uniquely predicting state).</p>

 <p>
 All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create
 a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a
 prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not
 necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA
 caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack
 created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if
 prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context
 stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we
 don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing
 strategy (versus full LL(*)).</p>

 <p>
 When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and
 retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding
 to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks
 from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can
 definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we
 don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer
 context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive
 grammars.)</p>

 <p>
 The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA
 simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.
 This is slow because we can't save the results and have to "interpret" the
 ATN each time we get that input.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS</strong></p>

 <p>
 We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and
 that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set
 of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the
 context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache
 tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower
 than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of
 memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like
 to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve
 the speed of parsing across a large number of files.</p>

 <p>
 There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,
 which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that
 we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That
 implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to
 resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position
 in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in
 input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the
 full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the
 original A B C.        To make a       prediction cache work, we have to track the exact
 input  used during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps
 X to a specific DFA for that context.</p>

 <p>
 Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are
 likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry
 with full LL thing Sam does.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION</strong></p>

 <p>
 We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not
 dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,
 or when we force SLL mode.</p>

 <p>
 As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super
 constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like
 this:</p>

 <pre>
 ctorBody
   : '{' superCall? stat* '}'
   ;
 </pre>

 <p>
 Or, you might see something like</p>

 <pre>
 stat
   : superCall ';'
   | expression ';'
   | ...
   ;
 </pre>

 <p>
 In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer
 context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.
 In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the
 entry rule and not dip into the outer context.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>PREDICATES</strong></p>

 <p>
 Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and
 LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as
 it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate
 evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL
 ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during
 closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't
 build up a suitable DFA.</p>

 <p>
 When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any
 predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is
 more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,
 we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have
 true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all
 alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that
 remains.</p>

 <p>
 When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test
 those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no
 alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.</p>

 <p>
 During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and
 on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during
 closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,
 without this on-the-fly evaluation.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>SHARING DFA</strong></p>

 <p>
 All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a
 static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the
 same <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#decisionToDFA"><code>decisionToDFA</code></a> field. They also share a
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/PredictionContextCache.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn"><code>PredictionContextCache</code></a> object that makes sure that all
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/PredictionContext.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn"><code>PredictionContext</code></a> objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes
 a big size difference.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>THREAD SAFETY</strong></p>

 <p>
 The <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn"><code>ParserATNSimulator</code></a> locks on the <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#decisionToDFA"><code>decisionToDFA</code></a> field when
 it adds a new DFA object to that array. <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#addDFAEdge(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState,%20int,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)"><code>addDFAEdge(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA, org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState, int, org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)</code></a>
 locks on the DFA for the current decision when setting the
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/dfa/DFAState.html#edges"><code>DFAState.edges</code></a> field. <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#addDFAState(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)"><code>addDFAState(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA, org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)</code></a> locks on
 the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it
 already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that
 are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of
 threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#addDFAState(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)"><code>addDFAState(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA, org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)</code></a> method also locks inside the DFA lock
 but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the
 configurations' <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/PredictionContext.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn"><code>PredictionContext</code></a> objects using cached
 subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is
 safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing
 <code>s.edge[t]</code> get the same physical target <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/dfa/DFAState.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa"><code>DFAState</code></a>, or
 <code>null</code>. Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/dfa/DFA.html#states"><code>DFA.states</code></a> map. It follows the <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/dfa/DFAState.html#edges"><code>DFAState.edges</code></a> field to new
 targets. The DFA simulator will either find <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/dfa/DFAState.html#edges"><code>DFAState.edges</code></a> to be
 <code>null</code>, to be non-<code>null</code> and <code>dfa.edges[t]</code> null, or
 <code>dfa.edges[t]</code> to be non-null. The
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#addDFAEdge(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState,%20int,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)"><code>addDFAEdge(org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFA, org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState, int, org.antlr.v4.runtime.dfa.DFAState)</code></a> method could be racing to set the field
 but in either case the DFA simulator works; if <code>null</code>, and requests ATN
 simulation. It could also race trying to get <code>dfa.edges[t]</code>, but either
 way it will work because it's not doing a test and set operation.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>Starting with SLL then failing to combined SLL/LL (Two-Stage
 Parsing)</strong></p>

 <p>
 Sam pointed out that if SLL does not give a syntax error, then there is no
 point in doing full LL, which is slower. We only have to try LL if we get a
 syntax error. For maximum speed, Sam starts the parser set to pure SLL
 mode with the <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/BailErrorStrategy.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime"><code>BailErrorStrategy</code></a>:</p>

 <pre>
 parser.<a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/Recognizer.html#getInterpreter()"><code>getInterpreter()</code></a>.<a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.html#setPredictionMode(org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn.PredictionMode)"><code>setPredictionMode</code></a><code>(</code><a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/PredictionMode.html#SLL"><code>PredictionMode.SLL</code></a><code>)</code>;
 parser.<a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/Parser.html#setErrorHandler(org.antlr.v4.runtime.ANTLRErrorStrategy)"><code>setErrorHandler</code></a>(new <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/BailErrorStrategy.html" title="class in org.antlr.v4.runtime"><code>BailErrorStrategy</code></a>());
 </pre>

 <p>
 If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax
 error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.</p>

 <p>
 The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the
 grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,
 the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a
 subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,
 then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL
 set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision
 is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the
 SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would
 rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's
 the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL
 analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an
 alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same
 alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting
 alternatives.</p>

 <p>
 Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives <code>{1, 2, 3}</code> and
 a smaller LL set called <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em> is <code>{2, 3}</code>, then SLL
 parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If
 <em>s</em> is <code>{1, 2}</code> or <code>{1, 3}</code> then both SLL and LL will
 choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either
 set. If <em>s</em> is <code>{2}</code> or <code>{3}</code> then SLL will get a syntax
 error. If <em>s</em> is <code>{1}</code> then SLL will succeed.</p>

 <p>
 Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in
 both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over
 the input.</p></div>

<div class="block">Performs ATN simulation to compute a predicted alternative based
  upon the remaining input, but also updates the DFA cache to avoid
  having to traverse the ATN again for the same input sequence.

         There are some key conditions we're looking for after computing a new
         set of ATN configs (proposed DFA state):
 if the set is empty, there is no viable alternative for current symbol
 does the state uniquely predict an alternative?
 does the state have a conflict that would prevent us from
                 putting it on the work list?

         We also have some key operations to do:
 add an edge from previous DFA state to potentially new DFA state, D,
                 upon current symbol but only if adding to work list, which means in all
                 cases except no viable alternative (and possibly non-greedy decisions?)
 collecting predicates and adding semantic context to DFA accept states
 adding rule context to context-sensitive DFA accept states
 consuming an input symbol
 reporting a conflict

 set.

 <ol>
 <li>Evaluate the precedence predicates for each configuration using
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/SemanticContext.html#evalPrecedence(org.antlr.v4.runtime.Recognizer,%20org.antlr.v4.runtime.RuleContext)"><code>SemanticContext.evalPrecedence(org.antlr.v4.runtime.Recognizer&lt;?, ?&gt;, org.antlr.v4.runtime.RuleContext)</code></a>.</li>
 <li>When <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ATNConfig.html#isPrecedenceFilterSuppressed()"><code>ATNConfig.isPrecedenceFilterSuppressed()</code></a> is <code>false</code>,
 remove all configurations which predict an alternative greater than 1,
 for which another configuration that predicts alternative 1 is in the
 same ATN state with the same prediction context. This transformation is
 valid for the following reasons:
 <ul>
 <li>The closure block cannot contain any epsilon transitions which bypass
 the body of the closure, so all states reachable via alternative 1 are
 part of the precedence alternatives of the transformed left-recursive
 rule.</li>
 <li>The "primary" portion of a left recursive rule cannot contain an
 epsilon transition, so the only way an alternative other than 1 can exist
 in a state that is also reachable via alternative 1 is by nesting calls
 to the left-recursive rule, with the outer calls not being at the
 preferred precedence level. The
 <a href="../../../../../org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ATNConfig.html#isPrecedenceFilterSuppressed()"><code>ATNConfig.isPrecedenceFilterSuppressed()</code></a> property marks ATN
 configurations which do not meet this condition, and therefore are not
 eligible for elimination during the filtering process.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ol>

 <p>
 The prediction context must be considered by this filter to address
 situations like the following.
 </p>
 <code>
 <pre>
 grammar TA;
 prog: statement* EOF;
 statement: letterA | statement letterA 'b' ;
 letterA: 'a';
 </pre>
 </code>
 <p>
 If the above grammar, the ATN state immediately before the token
 reference <code>'a'</code> in <code>letterA</code> is reachable from the left edge
 of both the primary and closure blocks of the left-recursive rule
 <code>statement</code>. The prediction context associated with each of these
 configurations distinguishes between them, and prevents the alternative
 which stepped out to <code>prog</code> (and then back in to <code>statement</code>
 from being eliminated by the filter.

 The default implementation of this method uses the following

<div class="block">Sam pointed out a problem with the previous definition, v3, of
         ambiguous states. If we have another state associated with conflicting
         alternatives, we should keep going. For example, the following grammar

         s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;

         When the ATN simulation reaches the state before ';', it has a DFA
         state that looks like: [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. Naturally
         12|1|[] and 12|2|[] conflict, but we cannot stop processing this node
         because alternative to has another way to continue, via [6|2|[]].
         The key is that we have a single state that has config's only associated
         with a single alternative, 2, and crucially the state transitions
         among the configurations are all non-epsilon transitions. That means
         we don't consider any conflicts that include alternative 2. So, we
         ignore the conflict between alts 1 and 2. We ignore a set of
         conflicting alts when there is an intersection with an alternative
         associated with a single alt state in the state&rarr;config-list map.

         It's also the case that we might have two conflicting configurations but
         also a 3rd nonconflicting configuration for a different alternative:
         [1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]]. This can come about from grammar:

         a : A | A | A B ;

         After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
         State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
         conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
         However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not
         stop working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned
         with states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt
         3 is not associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
         looking for input reasonably, I don't declare the state done. We
         ignore a set of conflicting alts when we have an alternative
         that we still need to pursue.</div>
